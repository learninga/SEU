在今年这种特殊的环境下，这个学期的分布式系统课程最终也结课了。虽然整个授课过程都没有和老师见过一面，但老师的授课内容和平易近人的性格还是给我留下了深刻的印象。这门分布式系统课程是我请求教务老师补选上的，哪怕老师在第一堂课说本门课程全英文授课难度较大也没有吓跑我，当时主要的原因是对于这门课程的兴趣，因为在之前的学习过程中总是听到分布式系统的名词，但总是没有系统地学习了解到分布式系统到底涉及哪些内容，而这些困惑在学习了本学期课程后也都被解决了，老师最后一周里课间给我们放的歌曲真的蛮好听的。
在准备做报告的那一个星期是我印象最深刻的，只根据一个主题需要去搜集相关的资料。但我的难点不在于资料太少不足以展示，我发现这个话题有很多的可以展示的部分，有太多的内容想要展示但时间又有限制，于是只得选取我认为最重要的部分，这在一定程度上也锻炼了我信息筛选的能力。

In this particular environment this year, the distributed systems course for this semester has finally come to an end. Although I hadn't met the teacher once during the whole lesson, I was still impressed by your content and down-to-earth personality. The main reason was that I was interested in this course because I had always heard the term "distributed system" during my previous studies, but I hadn't systematically learnt about the content of distributed system, and all these confusions were solved after studying this semester's course.
The week of preparing for the presentation was the most impressive for me, gathering information based only on the need for a topic. But my difficulty was not that there was too little information to show, I found that there was a lot to show on this topic, too much content to show and time constraints, so I had to choose the most important parts, which to some extent exercised my ability to filter information.
